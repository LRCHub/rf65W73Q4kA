She said she was a lucky girl
With diamond rings and pretty curls
Living in a social world
She was known by name

In her eyes a memory
Dreams become reality
Through empty words and flattery
Her heart remains the same

She is high-flying lonely
Two times so far away
Reckless nights that used to be
So loving and so free

She wonders where the years have gone
Time won't wait for anyone
So once again the lonely one
Waits another day

She is high-flying lonely
Two times so far away
Reckless nights that used to be
So loving and so free

She said she was a lucky girl
Such a lucky girl!
She said she was a lucky girl
