Ah, what can I do?
Ah, what can I do?
Imagine how many pride you've broke
Imagine how many hearts you've stole
Everyone in town knows about you
Happy go lucky girl
The life you live isn't good
Hard-headed girl
I have tried my best to change you
Oh, how much I'd love to control you
Ah, happy go lucky girl
Ah, happy go lucky girl
Imagine how many pride you've broke
Imagine how many hearts you've stole
Everyone in town knows about you
Happy go lucky girl
The life you live isn't good
Hard-headed girl
I have tried my best to change you
Oh, how much I'd love to control you
Ah, happy go lucky girl
Ah, happy go lucky girl
Ah, happy go lucky girl...
