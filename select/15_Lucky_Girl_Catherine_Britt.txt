Lucky girl
She got the diamond but I got the world
It's my oyster and it's full of pearls
So honey tell me who's the lucky girl
You lucky boy
Did you tell her she's your second choice
Cause I wouldn't be your little toy
Ain't no man inside her lucky boy.
Guess you finally found someone who's
Everything that I couldn't be
Whoah oh oh oh oh oh oh
I just couldn't see myself as
Mrs you can walk all over me
So tell me who's the lucky
Tell me who's the lucky girl
Lucky girl
She got the Gucci gown the veil and curls
I got your precious box set of Merle
So honey tell me who's the lucky girl.
CHORUS
Lucky girl
She got the diamond but I got the world
It's my oyster and it's full of pearls
So honey tell me who's the lucky girl.
